## 🪞 Design Scope

Your visiting card must have **two sides**:

### ✅ 1. Front Side

* Company Logo & Name
* Person’s Name, Title
* Tagline or Design Element

### ✅ 2. Back Side

* Contact Info: Phone, Email, Website
* Address / Location
* Social Media Icons (Optional)

---

## 🎨 CSS Styling Guidelines

Use modern CSS to create a **visually appealing and print-friendly card**.

### 🎯 Goals per Section:

#### ✅ Background & Layout

* Use gradients, solid colors, patterns, or images as card backgrounds.
* Prefer `mm` and `pt` for print dimensions.
* Suggested Size: `90mm x 50mm` or `85mm x 55mm`.

#### ✅ Typography

* Use custom fonts and define clear hierarchy (Name > Title > Details).
* Ensure readability at small font sizes.

#### ✅ Shape & Style

* Use `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, `transform`, and layering techniques.
* You can rotate or animate card flip using CSS (bonus).

#### ✅ Contact Section (Back Side)

* Icons for mobile/email/web improve visual appeal.
* Use `flex`, `grid`, or custom layouts to align neatly.
